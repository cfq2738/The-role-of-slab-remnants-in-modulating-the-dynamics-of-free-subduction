# The-role-of-slab-remnants-in-modulating-the-dynamics-of-free-subduction
Files necessary to reproduce models presented in "The role of slab remnants in modulating the dynamics of free subduction: a 3-D spherical numerical study", a manuscript in preparation. The input files are organised by their model names.

The Fluidity computational modelling framework, including source code and documentation, is available from https://fluidityproject.github.io/; the version used for the simulations presented herein has been archived at https://zenodo.org/record/5636819\#.YYBeydZBxR4. To generate the mesh, execute `python icosahedral_gmsh_new.py icosahedron 2.22 5` in the icosahedral_mesh sub-directory, where `icosahedron` is the output mesh, `2.22` is the non-dimensionalised radius of Earth and `5` is the number of subdivisions used to generate the mesh used for the simulations. The problem should be decomposed into multiple subdomains to benefit from parallelism, by executing `mpirun -np NCPUS flredecomp fluidity_file decomposed_file`, where you should replace `NCPUS` by the number of subdomains, `fluidity_file` by the flml file without the .flml extension, and `decomposed_file` by the name of your choice, also without the .flml extension. Finally, run the simulations by executing `mpirun -np NCPUS fluidity -v2 -l decomposed_file.flml`. The output will be stored in VTU format, which can be viewed using ParaView, available at https://www.paraview.org/download/ .
